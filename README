-- SHORT DESCRIPTION: 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET EXAMPLE DESIGN (MAC+PHY, SINGLE PORT)
--
-- LONG DESCRIPTION: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE DESIGN GENERATED FROM XILINX VIVADO IP
--  CORE EXAMPLE DESIGN OF THE 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET SUBSYSTEM (PG157).
--
--  THIS EXAMPLE DESIGN IS CREATED FOR THE ALPHA DATA ADM-PCIE-7V3 THAT COMES
--  WITH 2 10GBE PORTS. IN ORDER TO SPECIFY THE 10 GBE PORT TO OPERATE UPON,
--  UN/COMMENT THE CORRESPONDING PIN ASSIGNMENT LINES ASSOCIATED TO EACH PORT IN
--  THE CONSTRAINT FILE. TO OPERATE, CONSULT THE IMAGE "vio.png" INCLUDED IN THE
--  ASSOCIATED DIRECTORY "doc". THE SRC_ADDR CONFIGURES THE 10GBE PORTS MAC
--  ADDRESS. THE INPUT TAKES ONE FULL MAC ADDRESS, E.G. "000504030201" WILL
--  RESULT IN THE ASSIGNED PORT AS "00:05:04:03:02:01".
--
--  THE DEST_ADDR SETS THE DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS THE ASSIGNED PORT IS
--  DELIVERING GENERATED PACKETS TO. RESET_ERROR, WHEN SET TO 1 CLEARS THE ERROR
--  REGISTER. RESET, WHEN SET TO 1 RESET/STOP THE TEST AND WHEN SET TO 0 STARTS
--  GENERATING PACKETS AT THE ASSIGNED PORT TO BE DELIVERED TO THEIR SPECIFIED
--  DESTINATION.
